                A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various
                purposes such as training, analysis, or prediction. Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the
                game, with the player instead allowed to control a character or environment freely. Well-known examples
                are war games, business games, and role play simulation.

                            World of Tanks (WoT) is a massively multiplayer online game developed by Wargaming,
                            featuring mid-20th century (1930s–1960s) era combat vehicles. Game is free-to-play, but

                            release on 21 December 2016. It has a cross-platform format for Microsoft Windows, MacOS,

                            game was announced that it was an April Fools joke before confirming its existence in June
                            that same year. Since then, Gaijin has continued a yearly tradition to prepare
                            unconventional events for April Fools' Day.
