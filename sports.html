                A sports video game is a video game that simulates the practice of sports. Most sports have been
                recreated with a game, including team sports, track and field, extreme sports and combat sports. Some
                games emphasize actually playing the sport (such as the Madden NFL series), whilst others emphasize
                strategy and sport management (such as Football Manager and Out of the Park Baseball).
