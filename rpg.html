                A role-playing game is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.
                Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal
                acting, or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development. Actions
                taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.

                            Grim Dawn is a role-playing game, in a thematically dark fictional world loosely based on
                            the Victorian era. Released on February 25, 2016, developed and published by Crate
                            Entertainment. The game takes place in Cairn, a dark, war-torn world where a once proud
                            empire has been brought to ruin and the human race was driven to the edge of extinction.
                            Cairn has become ground zero of an eternal war between two otherworldly powers, the
                            Aetherials, who view human bodies as a resource to use, and the Chthonians, who are intent
                            on destroying humanity before that can happen.

                            Overwatch is a team-based shooter developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment.
                            Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each
                            player selecting from a large roster of characters, known as "heroes", with unique
                            abilities. Teams work to complete map-specific objectives within a limited period of time.
                            Blizzard has added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge,
                            with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to purchase cosmetic
                            items.
